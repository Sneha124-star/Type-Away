# TypeAway

## Introduction

⏱ This is a typing game to analyse your ability to speed type with seconds ticking.

The game will present the player with a random quote and time how long the player takes to type it out accurately. Going to use the JavaScript, HTML and CSS skills to create a typing game.

I learnt about JS events

## Creating the Game

 Our game is going to test a player's typing skill, which is one of the most underrated skills all developers should have. We should all be practicing our typing! The general flow of the game will look like this:

  ✔️ Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type
  
  ✔️ Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox
  
  ✔️ As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted
  
  ✔️ If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red
  
  ✔️ When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time

## File Structure

We will need a HTML,CSS and JS files.

## Note

✅  This  is an event driven program that concentrates more on 'Event'.According to Merriam-Webster, is defined as "something which happens". This describes our situation perfectly. We know something is going to happen for which we want to execute some code in response, but we don't know when it will take place.


✅ To handle events (button clicking, typing, etc.), we register event listeners. An event listener is a function which listens for an event to occur and executes in response. Event listeners can update the UI, make calls to the server, or whatever else needs to be done in response to the user's action. We add an event listener by using addEventListener, and providing a function to execute.

🔴  I had trouble with JS and how to move the yellow highlight from the quotes as the user types in the message box, but could learn more about Event Listener and how to integrate the code. Inspired and took help from microsoft/Web-dev-Beginner.
